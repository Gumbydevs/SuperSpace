## Developer Tools

This project now includes tools to help keep the code clean and catch mistakes early. These do not change how the game works.

- **Lint code:**

  ```
  npm run lint
  ```

  Checks for code issues and style problems.

- **Format code:**

  ```
  npm run format
  ```

  Automatically fixes code style (spacing, quotes, etc).

- **Run tests:**
  ```
  npm run test:unit
  ```
  Runs automated tests (currently just an example).

You can ignore these if you want, but they help keep things tidy and working!
